\begin{abstract}
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) are parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods that enable efficient adaptation of large language models. LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by using low-rank decomposition, while QLoRA extends this approach with quantization techniques, enabling fine-tuning of extremely large models on consumer hardware. These methods have revolutionized how we approach fine-tuning of large-scale models.

\section{Introduction}

The increasing size of language models (e.g., GPT-3 with 175B parameters, PaLM with 540B parameters) has made full fine-tuning computationally prohibitive. Traditional fine-tuning methods require storing and updating all model parameters, which is infeasible for most researchers and practitioners.

\section{LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)}

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation}

LoRA is based on the hypothesis that the weight updates during fine-tuning have low intrinsic rank. For a pre-trained weight matrix $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$, the update can be represented as:
\begin{equation}
W = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA
\end{equation}
Where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$, and $r \ll \min(d,k)$.

\subsection{Architecture}

Instead of updating all parameters of the pre-trained model, LoRA introduces small low-rank matrices that capture task-specific knowledge. This means the original model weights remain frozen, while only a tiny fraction of parameters are trained, significantly reducing memory and compute requirements.

\subsection{Key Advantages}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Parameter Efficiency}: Reduces trainable parameters by 100-1000x
\item \textbf{Memory Efficiency}: No need to store optimizer states for all parameters
\item \textbf{Flexibility}: Can be applied to any linear layer in transformer architecture
\item \textbf{Composability}: Multiple LoRA adapters can be combined or switched
\end{itemize}

\section{QLoRA (Quantized LoRA)}

\subsection{Quantization Techniques}

QLoRA introduces several quantization innovations:

\subsubsection{4-bit NormalFloat (NF4)}
A theoretically optimal quantization data type for normally distributed weights:
\begin{equation}
q_i = \frac{1}{2}(Q_{\mathcal{N}(0,1)}(\frac{i}{2^n}) + Q_{\mathcal{N}(0,1)}(\frac{i+1}{2^n}))
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Double Quantization}
Quantizing the quantization constants for additional memory savings.

\subsubsection{Paged Optimizers}
Using NVIDIA unified memory to handle memory spikes during training.

\section{Conclusion}

LoRA and QLoRA represent significant advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning. LoRA's low-rank adaptation approach provides an elegant solution to the parameter efficiency problem, while QLoRA's quantization techniques enable fine-tuning of massive models on consumer hardware. These methods have democratized access to large language model fine-tuning and opened new possibilities for research and application development.
